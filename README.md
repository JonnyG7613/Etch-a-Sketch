# Etch-a-Sketch

This is an Etch-a-Sketch website that does a few basic functions.

The first is set-size which allows you to change the size of the blackboard based on the slider, from 16x16 to 100x100 individual grids inside the blackboard. It also clears the board when used.

The second is the color black, which colors the squares that are hovered over.

The third is random colors, which randomly colors the squares that are hovered over.

The last is the clear grid button, which erases all colors and puts the board back into the uncolored state.

1.0: Basic blackboard with four buttons (black, clear, random, set the size);

1.1: Added a border to emulate an Etch-a-Sketch, removed the set the size button, and added flair to the buttons. Also changed the color of the backboard.

1.2: Removed the slider and added buttons for sizes 16x16, 32x32 and 64x64.

1.3: Added footer with copyright and link to my github.

1.3.1: Changed the color of the buttons from grey to whitesmoke.
