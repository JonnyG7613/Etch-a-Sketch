# Etch-a-Sketch

This is an Etch-a-Sketch website that does a few basic functions.

The first is set-size which allows you to change the size of the blackboard based on the slider, from 16x16 to 100x100 individual grids inside the blackboard. It also clears the board when used.

The second is the color black, which colors the squares that are hovered over.

The third is random colors, which randomly colors the squares that are hovered over.

The last is the clear grid button, which erases all colors and puts the board back into the uncolored state.
